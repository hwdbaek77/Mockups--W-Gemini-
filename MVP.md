Rental Logic

Cancellation day before: full refund
Cancellation day of: renter gets fine
Spot ownership and renting documented with blockchain
Report system
If a student finds a spot they rented blocked, automatically reassign them to an open spot, and then pay the open spot owner with the original spot payment
If a student other than the original renter blocks the spot, fine that student directly and ban their license plate until they pay
Take photo for review using web3 photos for verification
Renting system
Spots that are available are highlighted in green, which they can do and they get a confirmation
Spots get more expensive by distance
Market rate can be fine-tuned
